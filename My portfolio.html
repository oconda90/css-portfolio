    In terms of actual coding and computer science i am coming into this as a newbie, which doesnt discourage me this only means ill have to work hard to get to
    where I want to be. Im very fond of this indusrty after seeing some of my friends go down this route but i never had the opportunity to start with a coding
    but thats when My friend Samuel Madrigal told me about Make School and i jumped on that opportunity and thankfully i got accepted and now im taking classes 
    and improving my skills
